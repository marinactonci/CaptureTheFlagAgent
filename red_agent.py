Description of the agent (approach / strategy / implementation) in short points,
fictional example / ideas:
- It uses the knowledge base to remember:
     - the position where the enemy was last seen,
     - enemy flag positions,
     - the way to its flag.
- I use a machine learning model that, based on what the agent sees around it, decides:
     - in which direction the agent should take a step (or stay in place),
     - whether and in which direction to shoot.
- One agent always stays close to the flag while the other agents are on the attack.
- Agents communicate with each other:
     - position of seen enemies and in which direction they are moving,
     - the position of the enemy flag,
     - agent's own position,
     - agent's own condition (is it still alive, has it taken the enemy's flag, etc.)
- Agents prefer to maintain a distance from each other (not too close and not too far).
- etc...
